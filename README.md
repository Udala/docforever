Proof of existence in the Bitcoin Blockchain using Merkle trees. No need of user payment. No account needed.

A service that timestamps documents. It gathers document hashes and it publishes the Merkle root in the Bitcoin Blockchain at the end of the day. After broadcasting the Merkle root, it is possible to download the Bitcoin-Merkle file associated to any of those hashes.

For a valid proof, it is mandatory for the user to safely keep the unmodified document and the associated Bitcoin-Merkle file.
